Hello everyone, my name is Fazry Javier. I am currently an undergraduate student at the Institute of Technology National Bandung. Sometimes, I love programming, but other times it can be quite tiring.
I love learning about web development, and I aim to explore building good and responsive websites using either native technologies or Laravel.
Feel free to having me as your friend.
